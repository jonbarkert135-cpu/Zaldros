Newest first. Each entry states what was *run*, not only what was written.

## 2026-08-23 — Reality audit + first desktop vertical slice
- Audited every component against REAL/PROTOTYPE/BACKEND ONLY/DOCUMENTATION ONLY/MISSING
  (`docs/REALITY_AUDIT.md`). Verdict: the project was documentation + backend only. Owner was right.
- Built the first UI: `shell/bedrock-shell` — Qt 6/QML taskbar and Start menu, PySide6 6.11.2.
- Ran it: rendered offscreen to `docs/evidence/shell-desktop-ru.png`, `shell-start-ru.png`,
  `shell-desktop-en.png`. 9 shell tests (backend + render/visual) pass; 44 tool tests still pass.
- Real data in the UI: locale-formatted system clock, running-app underline from `/proc`, memory
  pressure in the Start footer (shows `—` when unmeasurable).
- Wrote `docs/WINDOWS_BEDROCK_PARITY.md` (0 COMPLETE / 3 PARTIAL / 3 PROTOTYPE / 2 BACKEND ONLY /
  21 MISSING) and `docs/FEATURE_RESEARCH.md`.
- Still blocked: no container build, no VM boot, no hardware or performance evidence.

## 2026-08-23 — Owner decisions
- ADR-0005: name **Bedrock OS**, license GPL-3.0-or-later, Russian default + first-class English,
  disk encryption opt-in. Base-distribution decision reopened toward Ubuntu LTS + HWE, to be settled
  by a build test rather than opinion.

## 2026-08-23 — PART 5 integration
- Combined-spec audit, feature matrix, `bedrock-bench` harness, full §14 document set.

## 2026-08-23 — PARTS 1–4
- Phase 0 architecture, ADR-0001…0004, `bedrock-sysprobe`, `bedrock-hwinfo`, `bedrock-compat`,
  Containerfiles (never built).
